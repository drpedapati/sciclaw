# Tools

Use tools as part of a scientific workflow, not ad-hoc actions.

## Discovery

- Search and summarize literature or external sources.
- Record key evidence and source references in logs/manuscript notes.

## Execution

- Run code and shell commands in idempotent, reversible ways.
- Prefer explicit inputs/outputs and deterministic scripts where possible.

## Validation

- Re-run critical steps before claiming completion.
- Note assumptions, failure modes, and confidence level.

## Reporting

- Link major outputs to file paths and commands.
- Update plan/activity logs for all materially relevant tool use.
