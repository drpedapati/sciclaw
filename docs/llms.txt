# sciClaw

> A lightweight paired-scientist agent for reproducible biomedical research workflows.

sciClaw is a free, open-source AI research agent that integrates literature search, manuscript drafting, document review, and reproducibility tracking into a single auditable loop. Scientists interact with it through Telegram, Discord, Slack, or the command line.

## Key Facts

- License: MIT
- Author: Ernest Pedapati, MD, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
- Repository: https://github.com/drpedapati/sciclaw
- Documentation: https://sciclaw.dev/docs.html
- Install: `brew tap drpedapati/tap && brew install sciclaw`
- Platforms: macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux (amd64, arm64), Windows (amd64)

## Architecture

sciClaw extends PicoClaw, an open-source Go-based AI assistant. It uses a four-layer architecture:
1. Behavior templates (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md) — plain Markdown files that govern agent behavior
2. Runtime context construction — assembles skills, memory, and session history per turn
3. Thirteen built-in research skills — PubMed search, scientific writing, document review, bioRxiv surveillance, Quarto authoring, and more
4. Governance layer — hardwired lifecycle hooks for loop-level traceability (JSONL audit logs)

## Workspace

All outputs live in a single `~/sciclaw` folder:
- `sessions/` — every conversation, searchable
- `memory/` — long-term notes across sessions
- `skills/` — 13 built-in + user custom skills
- `hooks/` — event audit log (JSONL)
- `cron/` — scheduled jobs
- `state/` — runtime state
- `AGENTS.md` — agent behavior rules
- `HOOKS.md` — lifecycle hook instructions
- `IDENTITY.md` — lab identity and voice
- `MEMORY.md` — persistent memory template
- `SOUL.md` — guardrails and ethics
- `TOOLS.md` — tool usage guidelines
- `USER.md` — user preferences

## Built-in Tools

### docx-review
Native binary for Microsoft Word document review. Produces real tracked changes (insertions, deletions, replacements) and anchored comments in .docx format. Includes semantic diff between documents and NIH-standard Word template. No Word or .NET runtime required.

### pubmed-cli
Native PubMed client with full NCBI E-Utilities access. Supports Boolean queries, MeSH term traversal, field tags, publication-type filters, citation chain traversal (cited-by, references, related articles), and export as JSON, CSV, or RIS (for Zotero, EndNote, Mendeley).

## Skills

1. scientific-writing — claim-evidence aligned drafting
2. pubmed-cli — PubMed search, citation graphs, MeSH lookup
3. biorxiv-database — bioRxiv/medRxiv preprint surveillance
4. docx-review — Word document review with tracked changes
5. pptx — PowerPoint creation and editing
6. pdf — PDF creation, merge, split, analysis
7. xlsx — spreadsheet creation and analysis
8. quarto-authoring — loop-driven .qmd manuscripts
9. beautiful-mermaid — publication-grade Mermaid diagrams
10. humanize-text — natural tone refinement
11. experiment-provenance — metadata capture for every run
12. benchmark-logging — records with acceptance criteria
13. phi-cleaner — BERT-based clinical text de-identification

## Messaging Channels

sciClaw connects to Telegram, Discord, and Slack as a bot. Scientists chat in the app they already use — no terminal required. A CLI and API are also available.
