## Tweet 2 — The Dashboard

The new dashboard (`sciclaw app`) is a full terminal UI built with Bubbletea.

12 tabs: Home, Chat, Channels, Routing, Users, Models, Skills, Schedule, Gateway, Settings, Login, Health.

On first launch it walks you through setup — AI provider, chat channel, gateway service. Takes about 2 minutes. No terminal experience needed.

## Tweet 3 — Collaborative Routing

Routing lets a team share one sciClaw instance across projects.

Map a Discord or Telegram channel to a specific data folder. The agent only sees that project's files but still has your shared skills and memory.

The bot stays quiet in group channels unless someone @mentions it, so collaborators can talk freely. DMs always work.

```
sciclaw routing add \
  --channel discord \
  --chat-id 123456 \
  --workspace /data/project-a \
  --allow alice,bob
```

Channels without a mapping just get a normal conversation using your default workspace — no config needed.

## Tweet 4 — Provider & Model Updates

Anthropic Claude now works via OAuth token flow. Model discovery pulls live catalogs from all your configured providers.

The TUI has a model picker so you can browse and switch models without editing config files.

Also in this release: gateway self-detection fix, launchd reliability improvements, PATH normalization for Homebrew tools, and shared workspace read-only guardrails for routed projects.

## Tweet 5 — Getting Started

```
brew tap drpedapati/tap && brew install sciclaw

The setup wizard handles everything. If you're already on sciClaw:
