# sciClaw v0.1.56 Announcement

## Tweet 1 — Main Announcement

sciClaw v0.1.56 is out.

- `sciclaw doctor` detects host+VM Discord/Telegram conflicts
- VM auto-matches host version (no more stale installs)
- sciClaw branding cleanup across all user-facing surfaces

Upgrade:

brew upgrade sciclaw
sciclaw app
```

## Tweet 2 — Version Mismatch Detection

After `brew upgrade`, your TUI binary updates immediately but the gateway service keeps running the old version until restarted. This was invisible before.

Now the title bar shows your exact version and warns if the gateway is out of date:

```
sciClaw v0.1.56  ⚠ Gateway running v0.1.55 — restart service to update
```

Hit 'r' in the TUI to reinstall the service and clear the mismatch.

## Tweet 3 — Doctor + VM Improvements

`sciclaw doctor` now catches a subtle gotcha: running Discord or Telegram on both host and VM gateways at the same time. Messages get double-delivered and both agents fight over the conversation.

Also fixed: `sciclaw vm start` now installs the exact same version as your host binary. Previously the VM pinned to an older release in toolchain.env and you had to manually bump it.

## Tweet 4 — Getting Started

```
brew tap drpedapati/tap && brew install sciclaw

The setup wizard handles provider auth, chat channels, and gateway service. No CLI knowledge needed.
