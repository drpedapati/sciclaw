# sciClaw v0.1.56 Announcement

## Tweet 1 — What is sciClaw?

sciClaw is not a chatbot. It's a paired scientist that lives on your computer.

You talk to it in Telegram or Discord. It reads your data files, searches PubMed, drafts manuscripts in Word with tracked changes, and builds figures — all without uploading your data to the cloud.

Think of it as a research assistant that actually does the work, not just answers questions.

v0.1.56 just dropped:

## Tweet 2 — How it's different from ChatGPT / Claude

ChatGPT is a conversation. You paste text in, get text back.

sciClaw is an agent. It has your project files, your analysis scripts, your bibliography. When you say "draft a methods section using the attached protocol," it reads the protocol, searches PubMed for the last 5 years, and gives you a .docx with tracked changes you review in Microsoft Word.

It doesn't just talk about your work. It does your work, with you.

## Tweet 3 — What's new in v0.1.56

For existing users:

- Version displayed in the dashboard title bar so you always know what's running
- After `brew upgrade`, sciClaw now warns you if the background service is still on the old version — one click to fix
- Health check catches a gotcha where host and VM gateways fight over the same chat channel
- New VMs automatically match your installed version (no more manual version bumps)

```
brew upgrade sciclaw
sciclaw app
```

## Tweet 4 — Getting started

Two commands:

```
brew tap drpedapati/tap && brew install sciclaw
sciclaw app
```

A setup wizard walks you through connecting your AI provider (OpenAI or Claude) and pairing a chat app. Takes about 2 minutes.

After that, message it in Telegram or Discord like you would a colleague. It responds with real work — literature searches, Word documents, figures, analysis.

No terminal experience needed. No data leaves your machine.
